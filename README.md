# Feather-QUIC
A tiny QUIC implementation in Rust

[中文](./README.zh.md)

Feather-QUIC is a personal experimental project aimed at implementing the QUIC protocol in Rust while also developing a client tool that offers flexible configuration options for QUIC’s underlying features. Along the way, I’ll document my thoughts and interesting details from the development process through a series of blog posts:
