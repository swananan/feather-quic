# feather-quic
A tiny QUIC implementation in Rust

[ä¸­æ–‡](./README.md)

feather-quic is a personal experimental project aimed at implementing the QUIC protocol in Rust while also developing a client tool that offers flexible configuration options for QUIC's underlying features. Along the way, I'll document my thoughts and interesting details from the development process through a series of blog posts:

**Building and Debugging**

Currently, compilation is tested on Linux and MacOS platforms. Windows platform has not been tested yet, but it should be ok.

Build command:

```bash
cargo build --all-targets
```

Running tests:

1. Start the echo server:
```bash
RUST_LOG=trace ./target/debug/echo-server --listen 127.0.0.1:44437
```

2. Use feather-quic-tool for echo testing:
```bash
RUST_LOG=trace ./target/debug/feather-quic-client-tool \
  --target-address 127.0.0.1:44437 \
  --sni localhost \
  --first-initial-packet-size 1200 \
  --scid dddd1baa12 \
  --alpn echo \
  -e feather-quic-integration-tests/src/tests/test_files/basic_echo_input \
  --ssl-key-log ~/sslkey.log
```

Debugging:

- Use tshark or WireShark to inspect QUIC packets
- View internal feather-quic logs directly
