# Feather-QUIC
A tiny QUIC implementation in Rust

[ä¸­æ–‡](./README.md)

Feather-QUIC is a personal experimental project aimed at implementing the QUIC protocol in Rust while also developing a client tool that offers flexible configuration options for QUICâ€™s underlying features. Along the way, Iâ€™ll document my thoughts and interesting details from the development process through a series of blog posts:
